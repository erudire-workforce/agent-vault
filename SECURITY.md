# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public GitHub issue for a security problem.**

Report it through our vulnerability disclosure policy at <https://infisical.com/vulnerability-disclosure>.

Please include what you found, where, how to reproduce it, what an attacker could achieve, and how you would like to be credited.

## Scope and safe harbour

The full scope of the program, along with our safe harbour and coordinated disclosure terms, is set out in the policy linked above.

## Rewards

**This is a vulnerability disclosure program, not a bug bounty.** It offers acknowledgement and public credit rather than payment.

Infisical's paid bug bounty is a separate **private, invitation-only program** covering Infisical Cloud. It is not open to public submissions, and reports made through this repository are not eligible for its rewards. Strong reports here are a good route to an invitation.

## Supported versions

Security fixes ship in the latest release. Keep your Agent Vault installation updated proactively so you pick them up.

## Known limitation: WebSocket frames

The proxy scrubs echoes of an injected credential from HTTP response headers and bodies, but it does not scrub WebSocket frames. With `AGENT_VAULT_SERVICE_POLICY` off, a WebSocket upgrade is proxied as upstream Agent Vault does, credential injection included, so an upstream that echoes the credential in a frame hands it to the agent unscrubbed. With `AGENT_VAULT_SERVICE_POLICY=readonly-allowlist`, every WebSocket upgrade is refused with 403 before the upstream is contacted.

## General security contact

For compliance documentation, security questionnaires, penetration-test reports and SOC 2 requests, use [security@infisical.com](mailto:security@infisical.com). That address is not a vulnerability intake channel.
